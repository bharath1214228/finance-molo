But life can have a funny way of working out better than you could\u2019ve planned.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexa Lundin and Justine Ryan, the brains behind Size Beautiful Emporium, met while working at a major retailer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexa came from the UK, where she helped Jamie Oliver launch two new businesses in three years. Justine joined the retailer back when it only had a couple of stores, moving through the ranks as she helped shape several iconic Australian brands turning over hundreds of millions of dollars each.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI basically grew up with the founders of the business, working my way up to being a head product person,\u201d says Justine. \u201cI learnt how to do everything under them, from answering phones, picking and packing, warehousing, even payroll.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justine stepped out of the business to raise her child, then she got the tap on the shoulder to come back. Another big break, yet again, not in the way she would\u2019ve thought.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI was approached to start up a new business and bring on board new brands and create a label lounge or one-stop online shop for women of all sizes,\u201d recalls Justine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe idea was to grow online sales from 10-15 per cent of the sales of the brand <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and quickly add to the bottom line. I was to start that side of the business from scratch. That\u2019s when I met Alexa, about three years ago now.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then a curveball. They were made redundant on the same day. Alexa and Justine were sitting together, squeezing each other\u2019s hands, suddenly left wondering what was next. It was just before Christmas. They started applying for jobs, before having a breakthrough moment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe thought, well, maybe we should start something \u2013 so we did,\u201d says Justine. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really have any funding, I mean, a little cash, a small amount of redundancy, but had to live for the next little while on a small amount of money. We built the online store over Christmas, didn\u2019t hire any help and together did everything ourselves.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t<div  class=\"wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure class=\"wpb_wrapper vc_figure\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><h3 class=\"vcex-heading vcex-module wpex-text-2xl wpex-font-normal wpex-m-auto wpex-max-w-100 vcex-heading-plain wpex-block\"><span class=\"vcex-heading-inner wpex-inline-block wpex-clr\">Complementing skills<\/span><\/h3>\n\t<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \" >\n\t\t<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justine\u2019s journey in retail, combined with Alexa\u2019s ecommerce experience focused on marketing in the UK, made for a good match.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexa has always worked with brands with a purpose which placed emphasis on the customer journey. Both she and Justine both believe that all business is personal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt has been a really good partnership from that perspective, having a complementary skill set, which I think is really good,\u201d says Alexa.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cStarting a business isn\u2019t easy, we kind of fell into it. Had I wanted to build a business before? Probably not, but we\u2019d done it together, built a brand store before. We helped build a million-dollar business pretty much in the first year, and if I look back now, we\u2019ve pretty much done that in two years from nothing. We had no customers and now we have over 10,000. We actually should be pretty proud.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t<div  class=\"wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure class=\"wpb_wrapper vc_figure\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><h3 class=\"vcex-heading vcex-module wpex-text-2xl wpex-font-normal wpex-m-auto wpex-max-w-100 vcex-heading-plain wpex-block\"><span class=\"vcex-heading-inner wpex-inline-block wpex-clr\">Good deeds pay off<\/span><\/h3>\n\t<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \" >\n\t\t<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All business is personal for Size Beautiful Emporium, and the stories speak for themselves. Sometimes, Size Beautiful Emporium will surprise and delight customers with a handwritten affirmation \u2013 \u2018you\u2019re beautiful just as you are\u2019 \u2013 or receive a gift with purchase without any prior indication.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe\u2019ve had ladies write to us, \u2018I just really needed to hear that today, thank you so much\u2019,\u201d says Alexa. \u201cWhen you get those emails, that\u2019s your \u2018why\u2019 in business.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acquisition is important, something the founders learnt through prior business experience, but Size Beautiful Emporium is even more focused on nurturing relationships as they operate in a niche. The team is looking at launching a Savvy Sister Club and also hosting more events in person such as big morning teas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe have about 2000 or more customers in our local area, and we still do home deliveries in this area too,\u201d says Justine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThey ask \u2018are you coming today?\u2019 I even got invited to after-work drinks the other night at a customer\u2019s house. We want to help our customers in any way we can.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s a cost-benefit question, too. Inflows and outflows become harder to track with different payment gateways, making it all the more important to keep your eyes on the prize. That prize is the customer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe knew what we were getting into with an online business. It isn\u2019t free. We still pay rent with warehousing, we have to fund refunds and exchanges, they can cost your business a lot, that\u2019s the biggest bug bear with any retailer likely to tell you that,\u201d says Alexa.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf you do $1000 in a day and $300 in refunds, it wipes it off. You can\u2019t really be a true online retailer if you aren\u2019t going to refund the goods. If you genuinely care, that\u2019s just what you do.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t<div  class=\"wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure class=\"wpb_wrapper vc_figure\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><h3 class=\"vcex-heading vcex-module wpex-text-2xl wpex-font-normal wpex-m-auto wpex-max-w-100 vcex-heading-plain wpex-block\"><span class=\"vcex-heading-inner wpex-inline-block wpex-clr\">Keeping good company in business<\/span><\/h3>\n\t<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \" >\n\t\t<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Big business and government doesn\u2019t always seem to get it, something which has frustrated Alexa and Justine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s the challenge of being in small business and how we get support to do that from a wider perspective, whether that\u2019s government or financial institutions,\u201d says Alexa.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe banks don\u2019t really want to know, and government grants are often earmarked for businesses going international, but what about building in Australia? I think if there was something I was campaigning for, it would be that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s not about credit ratings and things like that for small businesses, nothing to do with that actually,\u201d adds Justine. \u201cWe\u2019d visited all four banks, done it all, been to them all. Unfortunately for us there was the Banking Royal Commission around the time we started our business. We\u2019d show them our sales, our brand books, everything, and it just didn\u2019t matter. Small business owners are savvy and understand money. They may offer a credit card, but that\u2019s not what we need. You need support and help to grow your business, really.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justine recognises the importance of surrounding yourself with people who get this in a business environment that\u2019s rapidly changing. Whether a financial backer or business mentor, you need someone who can pick up the phone, and in Justine\u2019s case, that\u2019s usually on the topics of inventory and marketing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cNumber one, with Moula, someone always answers the phone, and number two, if someone is busy, there\u2019s another 2-3 people that can always help us out,\u201d says Justine, adding that sometimes she calls just to \u2018catch up\u2019 and find out what\u2019s happening around the traps.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/moula.com.au\/finance\/what-is-cash-flow\">Cash flow<\/a> was the number one thing I wanted help with. We also have other mentors in business and people to go through marketing plans and bounce ideas off. We have contacts who have worked in different businesses, industries, maybe not run their own business, but they have great advice for us. It\u2019s important to get outside our own heads.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><div class=\"templatera_shortcode\"><style type=\"text\/css\" data-type=\"vc_shortcodes-custom-css\">.vc_custom_1518960096424{background-color: rgba(0,170,144,0.1) !important;background-position: 0 0 !important;background-repeat: repeat !important;*background-color: rgb(0,170,144) !important;border-radius: 3px !important;}<\/style><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid newsletter-sub-form vc_custom_1518960096424 wpex-vc_row-has-fill wpex-vc-has-custom-column-spacing wpex-vc-column-spacing-0px no-bottom-margins wpex-vc-reset-negative-margin\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><h3 class=\"vcex-heading vcex-module wpex-text-2xl wpex-font-normal wpex-m-auto wpex-max-w-100 vcex-heading-plain wpex-block text-center\" style=\"font-weight:800;\"><span class=\"vcex-heading-inner wpex-inline-block wpex-clr\">Good read, right?<\/span><\/h3>\n\t<div style=\"width:90%;\" class=\"wpb_text_column wpex-max-w-100 wpex-mx-auto wpb_content_element  lead text-center\" >\n\t\t<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<p>Get more insights to grow your business from our newsletter.<\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\n\t<div class=\"wpb_raw_code wpb_content_element wpb_raw_html\" >\n\t\t<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"newsletter-container\">\n\t<form action=\"https:\/\/moulamoney.createsend.com\/t\/t\/s\/okldih\/\" method=\"post\" class=\"newsletter-form\" novalidate>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"form-field\">\n\t\t\t\t<input class=\"fieldEmail\" name=\"cm-okldih-okldih\" type=\"email\" placeholder=\"Enter email address\" required \/>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"help-block validation-message\"><\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t<button type=\"submit\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">Subscribe<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"loading ticon ticon-refresh ticon-lg hidden\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<\/button>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/form>\n\t<p class=\"newsletter-success text-center\"><\/p>\n\t<p class=\"form-error text-center\" style=\"display: none;\">Something unexpected happened, please try again later.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div>\r\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A setback was the start of something beautiful for Size Beautiful Emporium&#8217;s founders, who\u2019ve built on their successful careers to carve out an online niche all of their own. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":13,"featured_media":18420,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"video","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false},"categories":[68,15],"tags":[7508,6160,2316,2318,2343,2344,2315,34,2252,47],"post_series":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v19.0.1 (Yoast SEO v19.9) -
