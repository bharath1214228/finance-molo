With physical shopfronts, COVID-19 had a profound impact on her business, but not in the way you might expect.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Born and raised on the Gold Coast, the young entrepreneur developed a strong work ethic working part-time jobs in her early teens, before carving out her niche in the beauty industry. Her mum was a beauty therapist, but the very idea of making a career out of spray tanning wasn\u2019t even a possibility until the early 2000s.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI was the second mobile spray tanner on the Gold Coast when I started; it simply wasn\u2019t a thing,\u201d laughs Jasmine. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhen I went for my first interview at a tanning salon, the owner asked, where do you see yourself in 10 years, and I said, owning your salon \u2013 I always knew it was what I wanted to do.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a sole trader, Jasmine started building her business 16 years ago. She took the leap and went full time with Bella Bronze Tan nearly 10 years ago, incorporated her company, and has been showing the naysayers ever since. (More on the naysayers later.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe business has grown significantly in the past 16 years, from two figures to seven figures,\u201d she reveals.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI opened my first salon in Mermaid Beach in 2014. Initially, they were only renting out the bottom floor, then said the top floor was available \u2013 I said I didn\u2019t need it, but about five minutes later I said, I\u2019ll take both, and I\u2019ll figure it out. It quickly became a coworking salon for tanning, hair, and makeup, before that was really a done thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cGoing full time was a dramatic jump, when I went from tanning 30 people to 90 people per week. I just gave it my all. Every year from then, until last year, we saw a 10-15 per cent increase in profit margins.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then COVID-19.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt was really bad for so many people, but we were very fortunate. We\u2019ve seen 40 per cent growth this financial year, even though we shut down for two months across both salons in Brisbane and the Gold Coast.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t<div  class=\"wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure class=\"wpb_wrapper vc_figure\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div data-vc-full-width=\"true\" data-vc-full-width-init=\"false\" class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid vc_row-o-content-&#8221;middle&#8221; vc_row-flex wpex-vc-row-stretched no-bottom-margins\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><div class=\"vcex-module vcex-icon-box vcex-icon-box-two wpex-relative wpex-text-center vc_custom_1625104485126\"><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-symbol wpex-mb-20\"><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-icon wpex-inline-flex wpex-items-center wpex-justify-center wpex-child-inherit-color wpex-text-center wpex-leading-none wpex-text-1\" style=\"color:#0ac6a6;font-size:3rem;\"><span class=\"ticon ticon-quote-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/span><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-text\"><style>.vcex_635a89f66c2f3{font-size:20px!important;}@media (max-width:959px){.vcex_635a89f66c2f3{font-size:20px!important;}}@media (max-width:767px){.vcex_635a89f66c2f3{font-size:20px!important;}}@media (max-width:479px){.vcex_635a89f66c2f3{font-size:20px!important;}}<\/style><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-content wpex-last-mb-0 wpex-clr vcex_635a89f66c2f3\" style=\"color:#ffffff;\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWhen I went for my first interview at a tanning salon, the owner asked, &#8216;Where do you see yourself in 10 years?&#8217;, and I said, &#8216;Owning your salon&#8217; \u2013 I always knew it was what I wanted to do.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row-full-width vc_clearfix\"><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><h3 class=\"vcex-heading vcex-module wpex-text-2xl wpex-font-normal wpex-m-auto wpex-max-w-100 vcex-heading-plain wpex-block\"><span class=\"vcex-heading-inner wpex-inline-block wpex-clr\">The COVID-19 effect<\/span><\/h3>\n\t<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \" >\n\t\t<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the glow up, COVID-19 brought Jasmine pause. With that, she refocused on things she\u2019d previously put aside because she didn\u2019t have time, such as redoing her website, and worked on new products, appointed an external marketing team, and launched the Bella Bronze Academy. All that within two months, before launching new salon services. Oh, and with a toddler in tow, and another baby on the way.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI started looking into different revenue streams I could bring into the salon for when we eventually reopened, and body sculpting was one of them,\u201d says the Gold Coast entrepreneur.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAs a service, it brought in six figures, instantly, for this financial year. It has been absolutely gangbusters since then.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Behind the scenes, the Bella Bronze Tan marketing team, based in Victoria, spent lockdown getting her up and running with Facebook marketing. In a competitive market of venture-backed brands, she knew it was time to step up to the mark. Having never run Facebook ads before, she immediately saw a significant uplift in website traffic and cart conversions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI grew everything organically to that point, but I realised over this last year, I just can\u2019t keep doing it all. Anyone in charge has to recognise their strengths and weaknesses, and outsource or learn to delegate accordingly.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t<div  class=\"wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure class=\"wpb_wrapper vc_figure\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div data-vc-full-width=\"true\" data-vc-full-width-init=\"false\" class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid vc_row-o-content-&#8221;middle&#8221; vc_row-flex wpex-vc-row-stretched no-bottom-margins\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><div class=\"vcex-module vcex-icon-box vcex-icon-box-two wpex-relative wpex-text-center vc_custom_1625015211809\"><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-symbol wpex-mb-20\"><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-icon wpex-inline-flex wpex-items-center wpex-justify-center wpex-child-inherit-color wpex-text-center wpex-leading-none wpex-text-1\" style=\"color:#0ac6a6;font-size:3rem;\"><span class=\"ticon ticon-quote-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/span><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-text\"><style>.vcex_635a89f66c8a3{font-size:20px!important;}@media (max-width:959px){.vcex_635a89f66c8a3{font-size:20px!important;}}@media (max-width:767px){.vcex_635a89f66c8a3{font-size:20px!important;}}@media (max-width:479px){.vcex_635a89f66c8a3{font-size:20px!important;}}<\/style><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-content wpex-last-mb-0 wpex-clr vcex_635a89f66c8a3\" style=\"color:#ffffff;\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cAs a service, it brought in six figures, instantly, for this financial year.

She was an early adopter of influencer marketing, and to this day, appears to feature influencers in her campaigns. As she points out, \u201cinfluencers haven\u2019t always existed, they were models back in the day, who happened to be my friends\u201d.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through trial and error, as well as friends becoming influencers with followers, and now fans, Jasmine has developed a sophisticated understanding on influencer marketing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She says Bella Bronze Tan has always received a better response when reaching out to people herself, particularly influencers with between 5,000 and 10,000 followers. She\u2019ll simply send them a bottle of tan, and kindly ask if they\u2019ll do an Instagram Reel.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe engaged an agency to do \u2018traditional\u2019 influencer marketing at the end of last year. I didn\u2019t see results. I didn\u2019t see the return on investment at all. Influencers with larger followings seem to get lost in the noise, at least that\u2019s what we\u2019ve found. It\u2019s also not my brand message. I\u2019m much more inclined to work with nanos and micros than major influencers.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t<div  class=\"wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure class=\"wpb_wrapper vc_figure\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><h3 class=\"vcex-heading vcex-module wpex-text-2xl wpex-font-normal wpex-m-auto wpex-max-w-100 vcex-heading-plain wpex-block\"><span class=\"vcex-heading-inner wpex-inline-block wpex-clr\">Good clients make great staff<\/span><\/h3>\n\t<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \" >\n\t\t<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a high turnover industry, Jasmine lives by the rule of only hiring clients, and empowers her staff through a coworking model.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She runs Bella Bronze Tan salons as a project manager, keeping a flat structure, recruiting specialist staff, and never hiring direct reports. While she stands to gain less financially this way, to keep good people, it\u2019s a trade-off she\u2019s willing to make.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cFor me, I\u2019m not a beauty therapist, and I didn\u2019t have the knowledge of all the areas of beauty to have staff work under me. There\u2019s definitely more money to be made if people work under you, but there\u2019s always a risk they will leave and compete. This way, we\u2019re all working harmoniously, and there\u2019s constant foot traffic in a like-minded environment. Plus, the clients appreciate you more because they\u2019re going to someone who is a trained professional in that area, not a hairdresser who does nails, and vice versa.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s a sense that most staff aren\u2019t working here while in-between things. If not studying part-time for other careers, many are building careers in beauty, and through example, Jasmine is focused on showing it can be more than just a job, and a rather lucrative career, when you focus on your craft.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cEveryone sees the growth in the business, and recognises it might not be just a \u2018job\u2019 \u2013 the company is not going away, and if you stick around, there are so many opportunities to be involved in different areas and create a career for yourself under the BBT banner.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\n\t<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \" >\n\t\t<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t<div  class=\"wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure class=\"wpb_wrapper vc_figure\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><h3 class=\"vcex-heading vcex-module wpex-text-2xl wpex-font-normal wpex-m-auto wpex-max-w-100 vcex-heading-plain wpex-block\"><span class=\"vcex-heading-inner wpex-inline-block wpex-clr\">Bottling beauty and protecting IP<\/span><\/h3>\n\t<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \" >\n\t\t<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest opportunity for Jasmine in recent years has been in the realm of product development. She started researching spray tan formulas and blends in 2011, before launching her own product in 2014 \u2013 \u201cyes, product development really does take that long.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her tip? Start yesterday, get your marketing down pat from today, and protect your IP from the very beginning. Also, be prepared to sink real capital into product development, especially if you\u2019re manufacturing in Australia. Jasmine spent $50,000 developing Bella Bronze Tan\u2019s premier violet solution, which was a relatively small sum, as she was fortunate to initially land on a manufacturer in Victoria that worked with her the entire journey.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI wasn\u2019t happy with what I was using, and the cost started to get to me, like why am I paying all this money for a product which isn\u2019t perfect,\u201d she remembers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt took two years to perfect the product with the manufacturer, through many calls, back and forth, and many more emails, often at 3 am from me. I did that while mobile tanning, with my sister as my first staff member, while finding a salon, being pregnant, opening the salon. It was really hard.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Jasmine has never met her manufacturer in person, there\u2019s something to be said for her loyalty, and she can\u2019t be tempted with a better rate elsewhere.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And as big as she is on brand, she\u2019s even bigger on intellectual property.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s so important you ask questions at the start, about protecting whatever you\u2019re developing, because if you start the process only to find out later you can\u2019t extract your IP, then what\u2019s the point? If you see the growth in other countries, look into how you stack up in other markets, so you can keep costs down and avoid exporting \u2013 protecting your IP is absolutely key.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\n\t<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \" >\n\t\t<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t<div  class=\"wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure class=\"wpb_wrapper vc_figure\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><h3 class=\"vcex-heading vcex-module wpex-text-2xl wpex-font-normal wpex-m-auto wpex-max-w-100 vcex-heading-plain wpex-block\"><span class=\"vcex-heading-inner wpex-inline-block wpex-clr\">Big things come from little boosts<\/span><\/h3>\n\t<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \" >\n\t\t<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Jasmine looks to other markets, with an eye on further expanding in the US, she has recognised the value of a \u2018little boost\u2019 along the way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She\u2019s keen to support growing businesses herself, which is why she has chosen to sell her products direct-to-consumer, on a business-to-business level, sidestepping cosmetics giants and our local department stores, so \u201cJanet in Toowoomba can make money selling BBT to her own clients instead\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Likewise, Jasmine recognises and remembers the cash flow boosts that have not only seen her through, but helped her own business scale and thrive. After investing in product development, Jasmine came to Moula for working capital, which she put towards marketing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIn 2016, I was a sole trader at the time, and even though I had been with my bank my entire life and they could see the funds coming in and out, they didn\u2019t want to give me a loan,\u201d she remembers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI was rebranding, and wanted a luxe look to complement our high-quality product, and the ability to order larger quantities of stock. The banks didn\u2019t want a bar of me.
