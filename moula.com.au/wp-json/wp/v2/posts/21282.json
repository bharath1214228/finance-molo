There were wedding singers, concierges, and coordinators, but there was no one-stop-shop business tying it all together for couples tying the knot.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The married couple, who started out as friends, started the first business of its kind in Australia, which recently ticked over to wedding number 650.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe first year we were in deficit, the second year we broke even, and the third year we turned a profit,\u201d says Kate. \u201cThen every year for the three years following that, we doubled our business.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t<div  class=\"wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure class=\"wpb_wrapper vc_figure\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><h3 class=\"vcex-heading vcex-module wpex-text-2xl wpex-font-normal wpex-m-auto wpex-max-w-100 vcex-heading-plain wpex-block\"><span class=\"vcex-heading-inner wpex-inline-block wpex-clr\">Going the extra mile for brides and grooms<\/span><\/h3>\n\t<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \" >\n\t\t<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Wedding Singer<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> might be a cult classic, however, White Clover Music has taken a more contemporary approach. Music is one thing, but Kate and Tom have packaged their skills to create a full-service wedding business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe may be the only ones who do what we do in the world,\u201d says Kate. \u201cWe\u2019ve created an offer that no one else provides, so it\u2019s really difficult to fully communicate what we do.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">White Clover Music is a live duet, MC, wedding coordinator and concierge service. According to Tom, the best way to overcome the challenge of communicating what you do is simply through demonstration \u2013 and Instagram Stories.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOur industry is a one-time buy, so we\u2019ve had to demonstrate and explain what we do continuously. We haven\u2019t had anyone come back for a second wedding. By continuing to show who we are and what we do, it keeps us on our toes, which is a good, healthy thing.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What that often means is stepping outside an already broad job description. Told through Stories, there\u2019s Kate re-icing a nearly destroyed wedding cake (don\u2019t ask), and footage of White Clover Music saving the day with a one-size-fits-all wedding dress (now a backup for every bride\u2019s big day).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere\u2019s a Navy SEAL saying, if you\u2019ve got two, you\u2019ve gone one, and if you\u2019ve got one, then you\u2019ve got none. We keep backups of everything. We don\u2019t like to say things go wrong, rather that they didn\u2019t go to plan.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Most of the time our couples wouldn\u2019t know these things happen until they watch our Stories.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Picking up steam, and skills, along the way, Kate complements Tom: \u201cWe compare it to a backpack, picking up different things along the way; enough to now fill our wedding van.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Practice makes perfect, and the couple have put in more than 10,000 hours together as a duet. Post-wedding, back in the van, Kate and Tom use that time to debrief, and hold space for what looks like a campaign retrospective.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cEvery time we drive home from a wedding, we have a proper debrief, and go through the things that went wrong, things that went well, how we can improve on them \u2013 and that\u2019s usually where we come up with new ideas,\u201d says Kate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think when people have a role, they don\u2019t want to step outside that role, so we just make everything our role. We don\u2019t see it as above and beyond.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div data-vc-full-width=\"true\" data-vc-full-width-init=\"false\" class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid vc_row-o-content-&#8221;middle&#8221; vc_row-flex wpex-vc-row-stretched no-bottom-margins\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><div class=\"vcex-module vcex-icon-box vcex-icon-box-two wpex-relative wpex-text-center vc_custom_1619075619283\"><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-symbol wpex-mb-20\"><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-icon wpex-inline-flex wpex-items-center wpex-justify-center wpex-child-inherit-color wpex-text-center wpex-leading-none wpex-text-1\" style=\"color:#0ac6a6;font-size:3rem;\"><span class=\"ticon ticon-quote-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/span><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-text\"><style>.vcex_635a89fb646eb{font-size:20px!important;}@media (max-width:959px){.vcex_635a89fb646eb{font-size:20px!important;}}@media (max-width:767px){.vcex_635a89fb646eb{font-size:20px!important;}}@media (max-width:479px){.vcex_635a89fb646eb{font-size:20px!important;}}<\/style><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-content wpex-last-mb-0 wpex-clr vcex_635a89fb646eb\" style=\"color:#ffffff;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThere\u2019s a Navy SEAL saying, if you\u2019ve got two, you\u2019ve gone one, and if you\u2019ve got one, then you\u2019ve got none.

Over the years, the business has refined the number of packages it offers, such as ceremony plus coordinator, or all-day package. This has simplified pricing and created a more predictable revenue stream.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt was kind of a question of whether we do ourselves a disservice and not be compensated for all the things we do, or book us to do everything we can to make your wedding possible.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And make it possible they do, through rain, hail, or COVID-19. Kate and Tom were booked out a year in advance when COVID hit, which meant they had to move fast. The task? Rearrange the calendar for 51 weddings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cA lot of our couples had venues and vendors who said \u2018sorry you\u2019ve lost everything\u2019, as they were in their own financial difficulties, which is heartbreaking,\u201d recalls Kate. \u201cWith some of our couples, who paid us 50 per cent of their amount, instead of losing that, we floated the idea of elopement considering they\u2019d already paid for the equivalent of that service.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their eyes, doing a disservice to one customer would be doing a disservice to all customers, so White Clover Music offered complimentary postponement on a 12-month calendar basis of every wedding on their books. It was worth suffering a short-term financial blow to save their customers\u2019 big days.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe\u2019ve found more ways to be flexible. You can\u2019t limit yourself by fear and anxiety. You will always come up against challenges, whether it\u2019s the global economy, an industry slowdown, a pandemic \u2013 there will always be something. Even if we were set back, we\u2019ve built this business once before; we can do it again, and possibly even better this time.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t<div  class=\"wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure class=\"wpb_wrapper vc_figure\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div data-vc-full-width=\"true\" data-vc-full-width-init=\"false\" class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid vc_row-o-content-&#8221;middle&#8221; vc_row-flex wpex-vc-row-stretched no-bottom-margins\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><div class=\"vcex-module vcex-icon-box vcex-icon-box-two wpex-relative wpex-text-center vc_custom_1619075636710\"><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-symbol wpex-mb-20\"><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-icon wpex-inline-flex wpex-items-center wpex-justify-center wpex-child-inherit-color wpex-text-center wpex-leading-none wpex-text-1\" style=\"color:#0ac6a6;font-size:3rem;\"><span class=\"ticon ticon-quote-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/span><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-text\"><style>.vcex_635a89fb64b42{font-size:20px!important;}@media (max-width:959px){.vcex_635a89fb64b42{font-size:20px!important;}}@media (max-width:767px){.vcex_635a89fb64b42{font-size:20px!important;}}@media (max-width:479px){.vcex_635a89fb64b42{font-size:20px!important;}}<\/style><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-content wpex-last-mb-0 wpex-clr vcex_635a89fb64b42\" style=\"color:#ffffff;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cIt was kind of a question of whether we do ourselves a disservice and not be compensated for all the things we do, or book us to do everything we can to make your wedding possible.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row-full-width vc_clearfix\"><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><h3 class=\"vcex-heading vcex-module wpex-text-2xl wpex-font-normal wpex-m-auto wpex-max-w-100 vcex-heading-plain wpex-block\"><span class=\"vcex-heading-inner wpex-inline-block wpex-clr\">Stick to core competencies, outsource the rest<\/span><\/h3>\n\t<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \" >\n\t\t<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only through pushing their limits could Kate and Tom determine their weaknesses. While they don\u2019t subscribe to a creative rulebook, they\u2019ve found it helpful to put certain systems in place. During the couple\u2019s first year in business, they developed a simple system that clarified their core competencies, and paved the way for outsourcing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhen something doesn\u2019t get assigned to someone, it gets lost, whether that\u2019s in your relationship or in your business,\u201d says Tom. \u201cSo what we did was create a 3-column system incorporating job and house roles, with one column for all the things Kate liked to do or was good at, another for all the things I liked to do or was good at, then a third column for things we liked to do but weren\u2019t necessarily good at, and hired someone to do them.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keen on keeping learnings inside the business, the decision to outsource wasn\u2019t treated lightly. However, hiring an external CFO, and later an accountant, would free the couple up to focus on their craft, and ultimately deliver a greater return on a more premium product. It also opened their eyes to the balancing act of business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe spent so much time believing we always had to work harder to make more money to keep cash flow up \u2013 that\u2019s simply not true,\u201d says Kate. \u201cCash flow is all about balancing incomings and outgoings.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tom recalls their external CFO saying, \u2018you have all this cash flow tied up in your future\u2019 for 200+ weddings in their calendar, however, without charging a booking fee or requesting instalments, they couldn\u2019t access any of it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cA business will always have incomings and outgoings, so it\u2019s about staggering both, and figuring out the sweet spot that works for your business. You can bill things more regularly, in lesser amounts, and you can pay for things more regularly, in lesser amounts. By negotiating with your billers, you can then create contracts that empower your business and work for you.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was on the advice of their accountant they came to Moula, to support the balancing act.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOur accountant put us on to Moula, which helped us when we were trying to grow,\u201d says Kate. \u201cWe needed new equipment, and knew our money was in our future, so we wanted to make sure we could start selling our upgraded package with new equipment.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Always on the go, speed was a determining factor. By linking their data, Kate and Tom sped up the process, and proved they were more than a couple of wedding singers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cGiven we are so busy working, and we earn more money working than negotiating loan terms, what mattered more was the fact we could just call Moula, grant access to our Xero data, and clearly show that payments were in our future,\u201d says Tom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe\u2019d sent out invoices that hadn\u2019t fallen due yet, so could get approved pretty much straight away. It was like a 20-minute phone call. It meant we could access capital immediately, use the funds immediately, and our growth continued.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOtherwise we\u2019d be running around after banks who didn\u2019t take us seriously. It was this idea of how Moula didn\u2019t put us in a box, that was really important.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\n\t<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \" >\n\t\t<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><h3 class=\"vcex-heading vcex-module wpex-text-2xl wpex-font-normal wpex-m-auto wpex-max-w-100 vcex-heading-plain wpex-block\"><span class=\"vcex-heading-inner wpex-inline-block wpex-clr\">Operating with a growth mindset<\/span><\/h3>\n\t<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \" >\n\t\t<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As business owners, both Kate and Tom have a growth mindset, believing \u201cwhen there is no answer, you have to create answers\u201d. Opportunities are yours for the taking when testing, learning and experimenting is your modus operandi.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She couldn\u2019t have done it any other way, as a self-described \u2018small town girl\u2019 from the Blue Mountains, who went from working property in Sydney\u2019s east, to going through the Your Shot DJ program before formally studying music.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSomething I wish I\u2019d known earlier, there\u2019s no rulebook in creative industries,\u201d says Kate. \u201cThere are licenses, qualifications, procedures, and things like that, but what you offer and your marketing strategy, it\u2019s all offered by you on the back of your imagination.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, White Clover Music\u2019s marketing strategy has incorporated hot air balloons and various stunts. Even when people have said \u2018that won\u2019t work\u2019, the couple have simply heard, \u2018that hasn\u2019t been done yet\u2019.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhen people say you can\u2019t do it, they aren\u2019t the ones willing to take the risk, so you have to trust your gut. People will try and limit your potential.
