He spotted an opportunity to launch a \u2018completely different\u2019 pet food company and hold himself up to a greater level of accountability.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Standing tall in a yard full of multinationals, Scratch is a subscription-only dog food service, making kibble with 98 per cent Australian ingredients.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minimising the middleman, and delivering direct to people\u2019s doors, direct-to-consumer brands like Scratch are getting cut-through in a post-COVID world. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><h3 class=\"vcex-heading vcex-module wpex-text-2xl wpex-font-normal wpex-m-auto wpex-max-w-100 vcex-heading-plain wpex-block\"><span class=\"vcex-heading-inner wpex-inline-block wpex-clr\">From strangers to business partners<\/span><\/h3>\n\t<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \" >\n\t\t<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most people launch businesses with friends, family members, or former colleagues. In 2018, Scratch\u2019s founders Mike Halligan and Doug Spiegelhauer approached the business a little differently.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI had the idea but I had no idea how to make dog food. Doug is the pet food guy. I just thought dog food could be done way better, and be way better for dogs, and with the right business model we\u2019d be able to cut out some of the mark-ups along the way,\u201d remembers Mike. (The retail mark-up can sometimes reach a staggering 80 per cent.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019d been asking everyone if they knew anyone who made dog food, and funnily enough, someone actually did. We met twice, and somehow I convinced Doug to quit his job.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t<div  class=\"wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure class=\"wpb_wrapper vc_figure\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><h3 class=\"vcex-heading vcex-module wpex-text-2xl wpex-font-normal wpex-m-auto wpex-max-w-100 vcex-heading-plain wpex-block\"><span class=\"vcex-heading-inner wpex-inline-block wpex-clr\">Being scrappy from scratch<\/span><\/h3>\n\t<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \" >\n\t\t<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What helps is both Mike and Doug are proud generalists. Owning their broad skill sets has served them well, especially in Scratch\u2019s early days, when they naturally found their place in the business through trying on different hats.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say either of us are amazing at any one thing, but good enough to get away with not having to hire people and do things on the cheap.\u201d says Mike.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI designed and developed most of our website, then we worked with a designer on our packaging, and a nutritionist to do thorough testing on all the recipes, which ended up being more of a collaboration than a testing process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s about getting your hands dirty and finding people who both like taking responsibility for something, and actually getting it done as well. We don\u2019t have a team of managers, we\u2019ve got a lot of generalists instead.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><h3 class=\"vcex-heading vcex-module wpex-text-2xl wpex-font-normal wpex-m-auto wpex-max-w-100 vcex-heading-plain wpex-block\"><span class=\"vcex-heading-inner wpex-inline-block wpex-clr\">The Mick Fanning effect<\/span><\/h3>\n\t<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \" >\n\t\t<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bootstrapping in the beginning allowed Scratch to stay true to its vision. In the venture capital-backed modern brand era, Scratch made a conscious choice to grow at its own pace.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solving problems with fewer resources initially helped create a competitive advantage, as the founders learnt to do it all themselves. Without a board of investors, decisions were entirely theirs, which gave them the luxury of pursuing opportunities \u2013 like that time Mick Fanning, the former surfing world champion, signed up as one of Scratch\u2019s first 500 customers on a mate\u2019s recommendation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keen to catch the wave, Mike nudged his mate over the next 12 months to organise a meeting on the Gold Coast with Mick, and talk all things business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe were working out if the timing was right to invest, and lucky it was. He had just stepped back from surfing, had more time on his hands, and saw the difference it made to his dog Harper\u2019s skin condition.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Scratch, virtually overnight, entered scale-up mode, that\u2019s when the team called on extra support. Immediately after a spot on 9News, the business saw three times the amount of sign-ups than anticipated over the month.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSales went crazy, and while it was stressful, it was a good position to be in \u2013 we needed extra capital to make more dog food and keep up with the demand,\u201d remembers Mike.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMoula was a really good thing for us to be able to quickly access capital to finance that inventory. The reason we chose Moula over others was we knew we\u2019d be able to pay the money back quickly within a month and it didn\u2019t have any early repayment fees. That made the biggest difference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThings like Moula help us operate the way we want to operate, with a bit of cash flow possibility.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t<div  class=\"wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure class=\"wpb_wrapper vc_figure\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><h3 class=\"vcex-heading vcex-module wpex-text-2xl wpex-font-normal wpex-m-auto wpex-max-w-100 vcex-heading-plain wpex-block\"><span class=\"vcex-heading-inner wpex-inline-block wpex-clr\">Keeping it under the one kennel<\/span><\/h3>\n\t<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \" >\n\t\t<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From developing creative to performance marketing, Scratch keeps everything in house, making collaboration easier, even with Mike in Amsterdam and Doug in country Victoria. This keeps staff on the ball, continuously testing, learning and optimising the marketing mix.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMost of the outside work was the packaging and the actual food itself. But we love to do everything we can, in-house, keep that knowledge, build on it and share our learnings. We don\u2019t really use agencies or anything like that, it\u2019s all about getting better ourselves.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Mike\u2019s view, Scratch\u2019s tone of voice is one of two most critical parts of not just the brand, but the entire business. Along with logistics, it\u2019s what sets the business apart from incumbents, as well as other challengers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s having a real clear point of view on what Scratch versus what another dog food company would do \u2013 that\u2019s a really big thing for us,\u201d he says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt helps our team know they don\u2019t have to get sign-off on everything they say; they can think for themselves. It gives them a license to make their own decisions without being micromanaged.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cDry dog food is quite a dry topic, and we\u2019re in a stale industry. It\u2019s a big business game, so all the life got sucked out of it. We were keen to bring that back as much as possible. Working with dogs, it should be the most fun, light, joyous experience.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div data-vc-full-width=\"true\" data-vc-full-width-init=\"false\" class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid vc_row-o-content-&#8221;middle&#8221; vc_row-flex wpex-vc-row-stretched no-bottom-margins\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><div class=\"vcex-module vcex-icon-box vcex-icon-box-two wpex-relative wpex-text-center vc_custom_1617845920616\"><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-symbol wpex-mb-20\"><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-icon wpex-inline-flex wpex-items-center wpex-justify-center wpex-child-inherit-color wpex-text-center wpex-leading-none wpex-text-1\" style=\"color:#0ac6a6;font-size:3rem;\"><span class=\"ticon ticon-quote-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/span><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-text\"><style>.vcex_635a89ff8bff2{font-size:20px!important;}@media (max-width:959px){.vcex_635a89ff8bff2{font-size:20px!important;}}@media (max-width:767px){.vcex_635a89ff8bff2{font-size:20px!important;}}@media (max-width:479px){.vcex_635a89ff8bff2{font-size:20px!important;}}<\/style><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-content wpex-last-mb-0 wpex-clr vcex_635a89ff8bff2\" style=\"color:#ffffff;\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cIt\u2019s having a real clear point of view on what Scratch versus what another dog food company would do \u2013 that\u2019s a really big thing for us.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row-full-width vc_clearfix\"><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><h3 class=\"vcex-heading vcex-module wpex-text-2xl wpex-font-normal wpex-m-auto wpex-max-w-100 vcex-heading-plain wpex-block\"><span class=\"vcex-heading-inner wpex-inline-block wpex-clr\">From drought to deluge and COVID-19<\/span><\/h3>\n\t<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \" >\n\t\t<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, things can still get in the way, particularly down the supply chain, whether you\u2019re an SME or in the big business game. Mike has a hunch that customers also expect a different level of service from a business which promises convenience on subscription.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scratch uses local ingredients, at the mercy of Australia\u2019s sometimes favourable, often brutal, weather and climate systems. Until recently, over the life of the business, farmers in our eastern states had been battling a multi-year drought, where conditions peaked in the deadly 2019-20 bushfire season. Now, in 2021, many of these same farmers have suddenly gone from drought to deluge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhen you\u2019re using natural ingredients impacted by the seasons, then you can really have a tough supply chain,\u201d says Mike.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf you\u2019re always in problem-solving mode, when it\u2019s too late, business can be incredibly hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAt times, you\u2019ll find you can meet the demand, you just need more capital to make more food ahead of time. Being on top of forecasting, knowing how much food we have to make, so we don\u2019t let anyone down \u2013 efficient forecasting makes a subscription business work like a dream.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even so, Mike admits the last 12 months have been tricky at times, due to COVID-19 and its impact on supply, shipping and logistics. In 2020, Scratch opened a new warehouse in Perth, adding to their Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane operations. Try as they might, challenges with Australia Post snapped the business into reactive mode.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAnything in a large box got really stuffed over by COVID, as Australia Post focused on getting as many small packages into a truck as possible and pretty much ignored the larger boxes,\u201d recalls Mike.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cYou\u2019ve got all these dogs wanting food on time, but our packages were getting deprioritised and lost in Australia Post, taking 3-4 weeks to arrive, which was an absolute nightmare. We ended up using couriers for a few months, costing us tens of thousands of dollars.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t<div  class=\"wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure class=\"wpb_wrapper vc_figure\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><h3 class=\"vcex-heading vcex-module wpex-text-2xl wpex-font-normal wpex-m-auto wpex-max-w-100 vcex-heading-plain wpex-block\"><span class=\"vcex-heading-inner wpex-inline-block wpex-clr\">Caring for people and planet<\/span><\/h3>\n\t<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \" >\n\t\t<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Responsibility to people and planet is baked into the Scratch business model. The founders are friendly with Koala, Who Gives A Crap, and other purpose-driven Aussie businesses, who together sound out ways to make an impact.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the beginning, Scratch has donated 1 per cent of its revenues to environmental and social causes. It recently doubled that amount. Now, 1 per cent goes towards dog welfare charities, with the remaining 1 per cent allocated to fighting pollution.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe\u2019re at the point where we\u2019re growing up so we can do a lot of the things we want to do, but never had the scale to do,\u201d offers Mike.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scratch recently applied to become a B Corp, a certification reserved for businesses that meet the highest standards of social and environmental performance, public transparency, and legal accountability.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThey judge you on your actions, not your intent.

Through carbon offsetting, reducing emissions, and a tonne of commitment, Scratch aims to neutralise its contribution to greenhouse gases.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe\u2019ve started to focus on the effects of ecommerce, which is delivery, warehousing and packaging, and delivering that in a way that\u2019s as impactful as possible, ideally being as positive or more positive than going to the store,\u201d explains Mike.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cCorporate social responsibility is something we really care about, although something that\u2019s hard to do when you\u2019re small.

That\u2019s because, from scratch, Mike and Doug have encouraged asynchronous, remote-first communication. (Top tip: Scratch runs on software called Twist.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2018Async\u2019 communication is when you send a message without expecting an immediate response. In an async environment, employees have agency to move projects forward on their own schedule. There\u2019s a focus on results, not hours worked. When a company can make it work, async reduces stress and increases productivity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWorking asynchronously means we post updates throughout the day and have a few meetings, maybe two or three, throughout the week \u2013 for a remote business, we run on very few meetings, and a lot of text updates instead,\u201d explains Mike.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s a very autonomous, \u2018run your own day\u2019 environment, where you update people and request help when you need a hand. Unless it\u2019s super important, people get to stuff in their own time.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming close to burnout in the first year of business, Mike says the importance of restoring boundaries between life and work can\u2019t be understated.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAsynchronous means choosing what\u2019s relevant to you, shutting out the noise, shouting out when you need a hand, and getting stuff done without distractions. The ability to focus, govern your own day, work from where you want, when you want, and just do a good job, rather than simply being online and contactable all the time, is the way for modern
