If it\u2019s a retail or real estate storefront on a high street, chances are, it\u2019s powered by VitrineMedia.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael took the opportunity to head up VitrineMedia Australia in 2012, as an Australian subsidiary under a French parent company, focused on selling LED display screens and signs. While he experienced success as a subsidiary, as the years went on, Michael felt ready to take the reins on a new opportunity.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI thought we had a whole lot more to offer as a wholly-owned Australian business,\u201d explains Michael. \u201cIn October last year, we bit the bullet, and said, hey, we\u2019d like to buy the business and distribution, and that\u2019s where it really started.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt was hard to break away from the parent company and lose the safety net of having their money behind us, and now it\u2019s my money, my life, attached to this business. But I felt confident and passionate enough about the business, and knew it would work.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t<div  class=\"wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure class=\"wpb_wrapper vc_figure\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><h3 class=\"vcex-heading vcex-module wpex-text-2xl wpex-font-normal wpex-m-auto wpex-max-w-100 vcex-heading-plain wpex-block\"><span class=\"vcex-heading-inner wpex-inline-block wpex-clr\">Achieving lift-off with Flight Centre<\/span><\/h3>\n\t<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \" >\n\t\t<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael had a track record for taking an idea and making it work. All he needed was a bit of momentum on his side.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the age of 12, he worked exclusively in sales, from menswear to the motor trade, honing his craft under the mentorship of his uncle \u2013 \u201cthe best salesperson I\u2019ve ever, ever seen in my life\u201d.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In sales, and business, as he later learnt, you gain momentum by leaning into the little tailwinds. Or, as any sales pro knows, turning a potential headwind into a tailwind.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael mastered the latter when faced with copycats in the early days with VitrineMedia. Competitors were importing knock-off LED products, which would often fail at the six-month mark. He needed to make a distinction.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>After deciding to personally remove the imitation product from other stores, he then offered the potential customer 50 per cent off \u2013 keeping his good name, while building up the business.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOne thing I\u2019ve always been a proponent of, when times are tough, and when the market is tough the way it is today, that\u2019s the best time to grow your business and make your mark on your space, so when the market turns \u2013 and it will turn \u2013 you will be that far ahead in brand awareness,\u201d says Michael.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The strategy paid off, with the right people taking note. Soon after, VitrineMedia landed a contract with Flight Centre to supply LED displays across more than 600 stores.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div data-vc-full-width=\"true\" data-vc-full-width-init=\"false\" class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid vc_row-o-content-&#8221;middle&#8221; vc_row-flex wpex-vc-row-stretched no-bottom-margins\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><div class=\"vcex-module vcex-icon-box vcex-icon-box-two wpex-relative wpex-text-center vc_custom_1614233402999\"><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-symbol wpex-mb-20\"><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-icon wpex-inline-flex wpex-items-center wpex-justify-center wpex-child-inherit-color wpex-text-center wpex-leading-none wpex-text-1\" style=\"color:#0ac6a6;font-size:3rem;\"><span class=\"ticon ticon-quote-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/span><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-text\"><style>.vcex_635a8a03c2286{font-size:20px!important;}@media (max-width:959px){.vcex_635a8a03c2286{font-size:20px!important;}}@media (max-width:767px){.vcex_635a8a03c2286{font-size:20px!important;}}@media (max-width:479px){.vcex_635a8a03c2286{font-size:20px!important;}}<\/style><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-content wpex-last-mb-0 wpex-clr vcex_635a8a03c2286\" style=\"color:#ffffff;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cOne thing I\u2019ve always been a proponent of, when times are tough, and when the market is tough the way it is today, that\u2019s the best time to grow your business and make your mark on your space, so when the market turns \u2013 and it will turn \u2013 you will be that far ahead in brand awareness.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row-full-width vc_clearfix\"><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \" >\n\t\t<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe Flight Centre contract was absolutely massive for us. It was huge. Apart from the value of the contract, it gave us an amazing profile,\u201d he says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOne of the biggest travel groups, globally, had done their due diligence and decided \u2013 hey, VitrineMedia works best for us. That was the launching pad for many other retail areas we\u2019ve gone into, like Retail Food Group stores and Clear Skincare Clinics.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flight Centre was the vote of confidence that VitrineMedia needed \u2013 in Michael\u2019s words, \u201cwe would\u2019ve survived without it, but we would\u2019ve struggled\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The contract provided a flight path for the business, but it didn\u2019t come with the promise of clear skies ahead. Scaling up created an entirely new set of challenges for VitrineMedia.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t<div  class=\"wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure class=\"wpb_wrapper vc_figure\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><h3 class=\"vcex-heading vcex-module wpex-text-2xl wpex-font-normal wpex-m-auto wpex-max-w-100 vcex-heading-plain wpex-block\"><span class=\"vcex-heading-inner wpex-inline-block wpex-clr\">\u2018Short-term help for long-term gain\u2019<\/span><\/h3>\n\t<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \" >\n\t\t<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cash flow, as any SME knows, ebbs and flows, especially in businesses that are reliant on contracts, and at the mercy of traditional trade terms. How can you realistically forecast revenue, and effectively manage your inventory, when you can\u2019t accurately anticipate purchase orders? In the absence of a crystal ball, Michael needed another solution.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIn the early days, as a subsidiary, our trade terms were really lenient \u2013 120, 150, 180-days, and the rest \u2013 so we could invest in huge amounts of stock and stagger the payments very comfortably,\u201d says Michael.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhen I took over, that was the first thing that changed \u2013 everything became a 30-day account, with 50 per cent required upfront, then it became 80 per cent upfront. When you\u2019re getting a $100,000 container every six weeks, it can get a little tight.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael got a business loan from Moula, so he could keep growing his business without straining his cash flow. He sums it up as: \u201cShort-term help for long-term gain\u201d.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOne thing I\u2019ve got to say, you can\u2019t grow your business by shrinking it. You can\u2019t stop spending and hope to grow your business, It just doesn\u2019t work like that. You\u2019ve obviously got to be smart with where you spend your money, but have to look at your ROI, and have to spend in order to grow.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t<div  class=\"wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure class=\"wpb_wrapper vc_figure\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><h3 class=\"vcex-heading vcex-module wpex-text-2xl wpex-font-normal wpex-m-auto wpex-max-w-100 vcex-heading-plain wpex-block\"><span class=\"vcex-heading-inner wpex-inline-block wpex-clr\">Reading the fine print in business<\/span><\/h3>\n\t<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \" >\n\t\t<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was that thinking, around five years ago, that brought Michael to his next big idea. In response to growing customer demand, he launched a print division. This was a time when the rest of the market started lasering into digital and backlist LEDs. Ironically, through print, Michael future-proofed his business, and modernised his business model.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe backlit LED screens have a 10-year warranty, so you sell to someone, and really have no reason to sell them anything else for 10 years \u2013 no recurring revenue streams,\u201d explains Michael. \u201cThat, to me, was a flawed business model.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A contract with coffee chain Gloria Jeans led to the formation of a new business division, focused on food-safe, sustainable print products. It\u2019s made possible by latex, water-based ink, which is soluble, recyclable, and importantly to clients, provides high saturation of colour.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div data-vc-full-width=\"true\" data-vc-full-width-init=\"false\" class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid vc_row-o-content-&#8221;middle&#8221; vc_row-flex wpex-vc-row-stretched no-bottom-margins\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><div class=\"vcex-module vcex-icon-box vcex-icon-box-two wpex-relative wpex-text-center vc_custom_1614233409341\"><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-symbol wpex-mb-20\"><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-icon wpex-inline-flex wpex-items-center wpex-justify-center wpex-child-inherit-color wpex-text-center wpex-leading-none wpex-text-1\" style=\"color:#0ac6a6;font-size:3rem;\"><span class=\"ticon ticon-quote-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/span><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-text\"><style>.vcex_635a8a03c2818{font-size:20px!important;}@media (max-width:959px){.vcex_635a8a03c2818{font-size:20px!important;}}@media (max-width:767px){.vcex_635a8a03c2818{font-size:20px!important;}}@media (max-width:479px){.vcex_635a8a03c2818{font-size:20px!important;}}<\/style><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-content wpex-last-mb-0 wpex-clr vcex_635a8a03c2818\" style=\"color:#ffffff;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cYou can\u2019t stop spending and hope to grow your business, It just doesn\u2019t work like that.

We\u2019re even looking at launching a print-on-demand model, with digital asset management software, which no one in Australia currently does.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael won\u2019t give away all his trade secrets, but he can reveal how forward thinking got him here. With two young daughters, he\u2019s thinking more about environmental sustainability, and turning a greater focus to corporate social responsibility in general.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cYou need to sit down and look at your business model. And not look at it from here into the next two years, but the next 5 or 10 years, and have a really good market study. Everything starts with an idea, but the idea you start with will very quickly morph into something very different by the time you finish with it. When I look at where we started, where we\u2019ve gone, where we\u2019re going, it\u2019s a completely different business
