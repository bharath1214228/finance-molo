It was important this process didn\u2019t change the properties of the nutrients, or the shape of Eloments as a business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eloments co-founder Nicole Lamond stumbled upon the concept of fair trade while backpacking around Asia and Africa in the early 1990s. Visiting tea plantations in East Africa and Kenya, she was struck by stories about conditions and pay. This opened her eyes to a new way.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People talk a lot about how you arrive at innovation, and I would say it often comes from caring about something, at least it did for me.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I was looking at this problem of farmers being exploited, wondering how it could be solved. They couldn\u2019t possibly work any more, yet their jobs weren\u2019t properly paid. When I came back to Australia, this idea essentially stuck with me: justice and fair trade.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div data-vc-full-width=\"true\" data-vc-full-width-init=\"false\" class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid vc_row-o-content-&#8221;middle&#8221; vc_row-flex wpex-vc-row-stretched no-bottom-margins\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><div class=\"vcex-module vcex-icon-box vcex-icon-box-two wpex-relative wpex-text-center vc_custom_1626306365440\"><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-symbol wpex-mb-20\"><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-icon wpex-inline-flex wpex-items-center wpex-justify-center wpex-child-inherit-color wpex-text-center wpex-leading-none wpex-text-1\" style=\"color:#0ac6a6;font-size:3rem;\"><span class=\"ticon ticon-quote-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/span><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-text\"><style>.vcex_635a89f198789{font-size:20px!important;}@media (max-width:959px){.vcex_635a89f198789{font-size:20px!important;}}@media (max-width:767px){.vcex_635a89f198789{font-size:20px!important;}}@media (max-width:479px){.vcex_635a89f198789{font-size:20px!important;}}<\/style><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-content wpex-last-mb-0 wpex-clr vcex_635a89f198789\" style=\"color:#ffffff;\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;People talk a lot about how you arrive at innovation, and I would say it often comes from caring about something, at least it did for me.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row-full-width vc_clearfix\"><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><h3 class=\"vcex-heading vcex-module wpex-text-2xl wpex-font-normal wpex-m-auto wpex-max-w-100 vcex-heading-plain wpex-block\"><span class=\"vcex-heading-inner wpex-inline-block wpex-clr\">Pioneering the Fairtrade movement<\/span><\/h3>\n\t<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \" >\n\t\t<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By this point, with the founding of the Fairtrade Foundation in 1992, fair trade had caught on in Europe, but not yet in Australia. Much has been said about the role of historical context and timing in determining business success. Rising to the occasion, the Melbourne entrepreneur \u2018met her moment\u2019, and with persistence and passion, launched our local Fairtrade arm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Together with Brett Inder from Monash Business School, Sasha Caulfield from the Australian National University, and Natasha Lewis who ran a fair trade business in Sydney, Nicole launched the Fair Trade Association of Australia and New Zealand in the late 90s.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First things first, they developed a trade certification system complete with labels like in Europe. Within three months, the association and labelling system was up and running, and they\u2019d already landed Kylie Kwong, the celebrity chef, as an early ambassador.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here and abroad, women drive the fair trade agenda, which Nicole believes often comes from a place of empathy. Nature versus nurture aside, as a single mother of three young children when she started on her own fair trade journey, this was a motivating factor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhen I look around, when I look back, and also now at any fair trade event, organisation or meeting, it\u2019s no coincidence there\u2019s mostly women in the room, whereas at a conventional business event, there\u2019s mostly men in the room,\u201d says Nicole. \u201cWomen have been driving this agenda, and I think it\u2019s an empathy thing, as most of these workers in third-world countries are women.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Nicole, it\u2019s always been an honest pursuit. She started Qi Tea, a fair trade micro-business, on the side at a stage when she didn\u2019t have a lot of time. Around 2007, she scaled up, and got Qi Tea into Woolworths in 2008. Entering a new stage of her life, with the right network, product mix, and proven ability to make a difference, Nicole then set out for her next adventure. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t<div  class=\"wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure class=\"wpb_wrapper vc_figure\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><h3 class=\"vcex-heading vcex-module wpex-text-2xl wpex-font-normal wpex-m-auto wpex-max-w-100 vcex-heading-plain wpex-block\"><span class=\"vcex-heading-inner wpex-inline-block wpex-clr\">Brewing the right Eloments into business<\/span><\/h3>\n\t<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \" >\n\t\t<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nearly a decade ago, at a creative writing meetup, Nicole met Julie Hirsch, who would later become the co-founder of Eloments. While they hit it off straight away, the conversation initially centered around words, not work. Ultimately though, it was written in the tea leaves.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt was about four years in where we said, what do you do for a living, as we just had no idea. It\u2019s great though because critiquing creative writing is quite a personal thing, requiring a high level of trust and great communication skills. We knew we could work together really well.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now as CEO and COO respectively, their duties are relatively evenly split, with Nicole in Melbourne and Julie in the US. In the early days, the pair became really close very quickly through the process of research and development, which put them in good stead for this most recent extended period of separation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cNot only have we been in the writing room together for the last nine years, but in the early days of Eloments, through our R&amp;D phase, there were probably only three days during a 12-month period where we didn\u2019t see each other. We were living on the cheap, sharing hotel rooms, putting everything into perfecting our blend.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the business was initially stirred by passion, its ongoing strength rests here, in product development, and providence is key. Where larger companies might buy on price, Eloments sticks with farms and cooperatives who they\u2019ve developed close, long-term relationships with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This makes for a more complex supply chain, however, the best teas, naturally, tend to be complex blends. Eloments sources tea from China, mint from Egypt, vanilla from Madagascar, and lemon from Spain. But that\u2019s not everything. When COVID-19 hit, they were in the process of moving manufacturing from the UK to Sri Lanka. There are so many elements that go into getting a Certified Organic, Fairtrade business right, before COVID-19 even comes into the mix.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Normally, the founders would visit their manufacturing site around four times a year, but that hasn\u2019t been possible since early 2020. While working across time zones, the founders have also been navigating launches into Amazon US and UK, on top of other marketplaces and retail partners, and investing heavily in their direct channel.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s shipping disruption around the world, factories have been closed under lockdown for extended periods of time \u2013 everything is harder and four times as expensive<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,\u201d says Nicole. \u201cWe\u2019ve found we\u2019ve had to really distill our \u2018critical success factors\u2019 \u2013 the factors that help our business stay alive and successful. It was said many times during the pandemic, if you can survive this and come out OK, that\u2019s a really good launchpad for you when things get easier again. We\u2019re one of those businesses.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t<div  class=\"wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure class=\"wpb_wrapper vc_figure\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div data-vc-full-width=\"true\" data-vc-full-width-init=\"false\" class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid vc_row-o-content-&#8221;middle&#8221; vc_row-flex wpex-vc-row-stretched no-bottom-margins\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><div class=\"vcex-module vcex-icon-box vcex-icon-box-two wpex-relative wpex-text-center vc_custom_1626306127550\"><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-symbol wpex-mb-20\"><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-icon wpex-inline-flex wpex-items-center wpex-justify-center wpex-child-inherit-color wpex-text-center wpex-leading-none wpex-text-1\" style=\"color:#0ac6a6;font-size:3rem;\"><span class=\"ticon ticon-quote-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/span><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-text\"><style>.vcex_635a89f198e5b{font-size:20px!important;}@media (max-width:959px){.vcex_635a89f198e5b{font-size:20px!important;}}@media (max-width:767px){.vcex_635a89f198e5b{font-size:20px!important;}}@media (max-width:479px){.vcex_635a89f198e5b{font-size:20px!important;}}<\/style><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-content wpex-last-mb-0 wpex-clr vcex_635a89f198e5b\" style=\"color:#ffffff;\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There\u2019s shipping disruption around the world, factories have been closed under lockdown for extended periods of time \u2013 everything is harder and four times as expensive.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row-full-width vc_clearfix\"><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><h3 class=\"vcex-heading vcex-module wpex-text-2xl wpex-font-normal wpex-m-auto wpex-max-w-100 vcex-heading-plain wpex-block\"><span class=\"vcex-heading-inner wpex-inline-block wpex-clr\">Finding the perfect blend<\/span><\/h3>\n\t<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \" >\n\t\t<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Product innovation is one of Eloments\u2019 critical success factors, and just like their values, it isn\u2019t easy to replicate. Nicole admits, research and development has cost the pair a pretty penny, however, they wouldn\u2019t trade this adventure for all the tea in China.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOur real superpower is innovation through product, as well as process,\u201d says Nicole. \u201cWe didn\u2019t actually know if we\u2019d be able to manufacture our product at first, but that\u2019s the very nature of R&amp;D, where you\u2019re dealing with unknown things. You can spend tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of dollars on something that might not work out.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eloments started off trying to manufacture in Australia, before ruling out suitable partners and heading to England. Nicole can describe so many occasions they came up against obstacles, where it simply would&#8217;ve been easier to add manufacturing aids, but they\u2019d lose their Certified Organic status in the process.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cBy setting that parameter, we made it really hard for ourselves, but we needed our values to drive the innovation. We were adamant at that stage it had to be a natural product.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a keen skydiver, Nicole refers to this concept as \u2018the point of no return\u2019, where Eloments had invested a large sum of money to cross the point. And just like skydiving, in business, you face a point of no return where it\u2019s detrimental if you falter psychologically.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For their philosophy, and phenomenal taste, Eloments has picked up a loyal customer base, now affectionately referred to as The League of Extraordinary Tea Tasters. Among other strategic partners, they\u2019ve also won the attention of Woolworths, and Organic Xlabs, a US venture capital firm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organic Xlabs is the investment arm of Eloments\u2019 vitamin supplier. They were intimately aware of the Eloments journey, as each time the business did another trial, they needed more sample products. And that happened a lot.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAfter we started manufacturing it, Organic Xlabs started to like it more and saw Woolworths come on board. At the time, we had interest from other parties, but nothing firm. We were able to get that deal over the line within 12 months of them first approaching us. Everyone can be a customer, everyone can also be an investor.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nicole says intellectual property helped seal this particular deal. She highly encourages other businesses to head down the patent path, even though it\u2019s often a lengthy and costly process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s really valuable, particularly if you\u2019re wanting to raise capital and bring in external investors. Have a really clear idea of expansion plans if you\u2019re going to spend the money on IP as you\u2019ll want trademarks in the territories where you\u2019re trading.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\n\t<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \" >\n\t\t<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n\t<div  class=\"wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<figure class=\"wpb_wrapper vc_figure\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey\"><\/div>\n\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div data-vc-full-width=\"true\" data-vc-full-width-init=\"false\" class=\"vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid vc_row-o-content-&#8221;middle&#8221; vc_row-flex wpex-vc-row-stretched no-bottom-margins\"><div class=\"wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12\"><div class=\"vc_column-inner\"><div class=\"wpb_wrapper\"><div class=\"vcex-module vcex-icon-box vcex-icon-box-two wpex-relative wpex-text-center vc_custom_1626305448291\"><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-symbol wpex-mb-20\"><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-icon wpex-inline-flex wpex-items-center wpex-justify-center wpex-child-inherit-color wpex-text-center wpex-leading-none wpex-text-1\" style=\"color:#0ac6a6;font-size:3rem;\"><span class=\"ticon ticon-quote-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/span><\/div><\/div><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-text\"><style>.vcex_635a89f199245{font-size:20px!important;}@media (max-width:959px){.vcex_635a89f199245{font-size:20px!important;}}@media (max-width:767px){.vcex_635a89f199245{font-size:20px!important;}}@media (max-width:479px){.vcex_635a89f199245{font-size:20px!important;}}<\/style><div class=\"vcex-icon-box-content wpex-last-mb-0 wpex-clr vcex_635a89f199245\" style=\"color:#ffffff;\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cBy setting that parameter, we made it really hard for ourselves, but we needed our values to drive the innovation.

The business used Moula as a working capital solution when they faced a gap in payments.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of coming back to the numbers, making sure if you\u2019re borrowing money, particularly at a higher interest rate, there\u2019s enough of a margin to cover the costs.

All businesses should incorporate CSR values, it\u2019s just a matter of execution and how you do it. Business should be compatible with social purpose. Business drives the distribution of goods and services around the world.
