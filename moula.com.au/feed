			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Eloments set out to make the world’s first 100 per cent Certified Organic vitamin tea, the founders weren’t sure if it was even possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took two years to develop a product without binders or fillers by following a process – now patented – that blends extracts with spices, vitamins and Fairtrade tea. It was important this process didn’t change the properties of the nutrients, or the shape of Eloments as a business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eloments co-founder Nicole Lamond stumbled upon the concept of fair trade while backpacking around Asia and Africa in the early 1990s. Visiting tea plantations in East Africa and Kenya, she was struck by stories about conditions and pay. This opened her eyes to a new way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">People talk a lot about how you arrive at innovation, and I would say it often comes from caring about something, at least it did for me.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I was looking at this problem of farmers being exploited, wondering how it could be solved. They couldn’t possibly work any more, yet their jobs weren’t properly paid. When I came back to Australia, this idea essentially stuck with me: justice and fair trade.”</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By this point, with the founding of the Fairtrade Foundation in 1992, fair trade had caught on in Europe, but not yet in Australia. Much has been said about the role of historical context and timing in determining business success. Rising to the occasion, the Melbourne entrepreneur ‘met her moment’, and with persistence and passion, launched our local Fairtrade arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Together with Brett Inder from Monash Business School, Sasha Caulfield from the Australian National University, and Natasha Lewis who ran a fair trade business in Sydney, Nicole launched the Fair Trade Association of Australia and New Zealand in the late 90s. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First things first, they developed a trade certification system complete with labels like in Europe. Within three months, the association and labelling system was up and running, and they’d already landed Kylie Kwong, the celebrity chef, as an early ambassador.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here and abroad, women drive the fair trade agenda, which Nicole believes often comes from a place of empathy. Nature versus nurture aside, as a single mother of three young children when she started on her own fair trade journey, this was a motivating factor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When I look around, when I look back, and also now at any fair trade event, organisation or meeting, it’s no coincidence there’s mostly women in the room, whereas at a conventional business event, there’s mostly men in the room,” says Nicole. “Women have been driving this agenda, and I think it’s an empathy thing, as most of these workers in third-world countries are women.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Nicole, it’s always been an honest pursuit. She started Qi Tea, a fair trade micro-business, on the side at a stage when she didn’t have a lot of time. Around 2007, she scaled up, and got Qi Tea into Woolworths in 2008. Entering a new stage of her life, with the right network, product mix, and proven ability to make a difference, Nicole then set out for her next adventure. </span></p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly a decade ago, at a creative writing meetup, Nicole met Julie Hirsch, who would later become the co-founder of Eloments. While they hit it off straight away, the conversation initially centered around words, not work. Ultimately though, it was written in the tea leaves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was about four years in where we said, what do you do for a living, as we just had no idea. It’s great though because critiquing creative writing is quite a personal thing, requiring a high level of trust and great communication skills. We knew we could work together really well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now as CEO and COO respectively, their duties are relatively evenly split, with Nicole in Melbourne and Julie in the US. In the early days, the pair became really close very quickly through the process of research and development, which put them in good stead for this most recent extended period of separation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not only have we been in the writing room together for the last nine years, but in the early days of Eloments, through our R&amp;D phase, there were probably only three days during a 12-month period where we didn’t see each other. We were living on the cheap, sharing hotel rooms, putting everything into perfecting our blend.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the business was initially stirred by passion, its ongoing strength rests here, in product development, and providence is key. Where larger companies might buy on price, Eloments sticks with farms and cooperatives who they’ve developed close, long-term relationships with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This makes for a more complex supply chain, however, the best teas, naturally, tend to be complex blends. Eloments sources tea from China, mint from Egypt, vanilla from Madagascar, and lemon from Spain. But that’s not everything. When COVID-19 hit, they were in the process of moving manufacturing from the UK to Sri Lanka. There are so many elements that go into getting a Certified Organic, Fairtrade business right, before COVID-19 even comes into the mix. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normally, the founders would visit their manufacturing site around four times a year, but that hasn’t been possible since early 2020. While working across time zones, the founders have also been navigating launches into Amazon US and UK, on top of other marketplaces and retail partners, and investing heavily in their direct channel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s shipping disruption around the world, factories have been closed under lockdown for extended periods of time – everything is harder and four times as expensive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” says Nicole. “We’ve found we’ve had to really distill our ‘critical success factors’ – the factors that help our business stay alive and successful. It was said many times during the pandemic, if you can survive this and come out OK, that’s a really good launchpad for you when things get easier again. We’re one of those businesses.”</span></p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product innovation is one of Eloments’ critical success factors, and just like their values, it isn’t easy to replicate. Nicole admits, research and development has cost the pair a pretty penny, however, they wouldn’t trade this adventure for all the tea in China.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our real superpower is innovation through product, as well as process,” says Nicole. “We didn’t actually know if we’d be able to manufacture our product at first, but that’s the very nature of R&amp;D, where you’re dealing with unknown things. You can spend tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of dollars on something that might not work out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eloments started off trying to manufacture in Australia, before ruling out suitable partners and heading to England. Nicole can describe so many occasions they came up against obstacles, where it simply would&#8217;ve been easier to add manufacturing aids, but they’d lose their Certified Organic status in the process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By setting that parameter, we made it really hard for ourselves, but we needed our values to drive the innovation. We were adamant at that stage it had to be a natural product.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a keen skydiver, Nicole refers to this concept as ‘the point of no return’, where Eloments had invested a large sum of money to cross the point. And just like skydiving, in business, you face a point of no return where it’s detrimental if you falter psychologically. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For their philosophy, and phenomenal taste, Eloments has picked up a loyal customer base, now affectionately referred to as The League of Extraordinary Tea Tasters. Among other strategic partners, they’ve also won the attention of Woolworths, and Organic Xlabs, a US venture capital firm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organic Xlabs is the investment arm of Eloments’ vitamin supplier. They were intimately aware of the Eloments journey, as each time the business did another trial, they needed more sample products. And that happened a lot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After we started manufacturing it, Organic Xlabs started to like it more and saw Woolworths come on board. At the time, we had interest from other parties, but nothing firm. We were able to get that deal over the line within 12 months of them first approaching us. Everyone can be a customer, everyone can also be an investor.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nicole says intellectual property helped seal this particular deal. She highly encourages other businesses to head down the patent path, even though it’s often a lengthy and costly process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s really valuable, particularly if you’re wanting to raise capital and bring in external investors. Have a really clear idea of expansion plans if you’re going to spend the money on IP as you’ll want trademarks in the territories where you’re trading.”</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nicole believes it’s important to have ‘different avenues and access points for finance’ as different types of finance suit different stages in business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The faster you’re growing, the more cash pain you have. If you’re in a high-growth phase, you often need to access funds quickly over a short period of time. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thing that kills most businesses is cash, or lack thereof, so it’s absolutely vital to get short-term cash quickly if you need it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It comes back to the numbers, which is what led the innovators to Moula. The business used Moula as a working capital solution when they faced a gap in payments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a matter of coming back to the numbers, making sure if you’re borrowing money, particularly at a higher interest rate, there’s enough of a margin to cover the costs. Unsecured finance is important, because as a founder, you don’t want to be under the stress of offering security, neither can every founder offer security. It opens up entrepreneurship to more people.”</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Fairtrade to gender equality and climate change, there are so many ways entrepreneurs can make a difference. The biggest thing, for Eloments, has been treating entrepreneurship as an exercise in focus – do one thing, and do it well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s energising when you focus on a single thing, otherwise you’ll end up feeling scattered and not on mission,” says Nicole. “Our mission as a company is to accelerate the world to a living wage for all people. We’re really clear about that, it’s something we’ll never sacrifice.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also never too late to incorporate corporate social responsibility into business, and for-profit companies are the perfect vehicle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m passionate about entrepreneurship and innovation, and for me, the best way to live that out was to have a for-profit structure as I could raise capital and operate nimbly. All businesses should incorporate CSR values, it’s just a matter of execution and how you do it. Business should be compatible with social purpose. Business drives the distribution of goods and services around the world. As far as I see, that’s where the power of change lies.”</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jasmine Scarr is a tanning technician who has built a seven-figure business in beauty. With physical shopfronts, COVID-19 had a profound impact on her business, but not in the way you might expect. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Born and raised on the Gold Coast, the young entrepreneur developed a strong work ethic working part-time jobs in her early teens, before carving out her niche in the beauty industry. Her mum was a beauty therapist, but the very idea of making a career out of spray tanning wasn’t even a possibility until the early 2000s. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was the second mobile spray tanner on the Gold Coast when I started; it simply wasn’t a thing,” laughs Jasmine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When I went for my first interview at a tanning salon, the owner asked, where do you see yourself in 10 years, and I said, owning your salon – I always knew it was what I wanted to do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a sole trader, Jasmine started building her business 16 years ago. She took the leap and went full time with Bella Bronze Tan nearly 10 years ago, incorporated her company, and has been showing the naysayers ever since. (More on the naysayers later.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The business has grown significantly in the past 16 years, from two figures to seven figures,” she reveals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I opened my first salon in Mermaid Beach in 2014. Initially, they were only renting out the bottom floor, then said the top floor was available – I said I didn’t need it, but about five minutes later I said, I’ll take both, and I’ll figure it out. It quickly became a coworking salon for tanning, hair, and makeup, before that was really a done thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Going full time was a dramatic jump, when I went from tanning 30 people to 90 people per week. I just gave it my all. Every year from then, until last year, we saw a 10-15 per cent increase in profit margins.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then COVID-19.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was really bad for so many people, but we were very fortunate. We’ve seen 40 per cent growth this financial year, even though we shut down for two months across both salons in Brisbane and the Gold Coast.”</span></p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the glow up, COVID-19 brought Jasmine pause. With that, she refocused on things she’d previously put aside because she didn’t have time, such as redoing her website, and worked on new products, appointed an external marketing team, and launched the Bella Bronze Academy. All that within two months, before launching new salon services. Oh, and with a toddler in tow, and another baby on the way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I started looking into different revenue streams I could bring into the salon for when we eventually reopened, and body sculpting was one of them,” says the Gold Coast entrepreneur. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As a service, it brought in six figures, instantly, for this financial year. It has been absolutely gangbusters since then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind the scenes, the Bella Bronze Tan marketing team, based in Victoria, spent lockdown getting her up and running with Facebook marketing. In a competitive market of venture-backed brands, she knew it was time to step up to the mark. Having never run Facebook ads before, she immediately saw a significant uplift in website traffic and cart conversions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I grew everything organically to that point, but I realised over this last year, I just can’t keep doing it all. Anyone in charge has to recognise their strengths and weaknesses, and outsource or learn to delegate accordingly.” </span></p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides tanning, the thing that comes most naturally to Jasmine is brand building. She was an early adopter of influencer marketing, and to this day, appears to feature influencers in her campaigns. As she points out, “influencers haven’t always existed, they were models back in the day, who happened to be my friends”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through trial and error, as well as friends becoming influencers with followers, and now fans, Jasmine has developed a sophisticated understanding on influencer marketing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She says Bella Bronze Tan has always received a better response when reaching out to people herself, particularly influencers with between 5,000 and 10,000 followers. She’ll simply send them a bottle of tan, and kindly ask if they’ll do an Instagram Reel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We engaged an agency to do ‘traditional’ influencer marketing at the end of last year. I didn’t see results. I didn’t see the return on investment at all. Influencers with larger followings seem to get lost in the noise, at least that’s what we’ve found. It’s also not my brand message. I’m much more inclined to work with nanos and micros than major influencers.”</span></p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a high turnover industry, Jasmine lives by the rule of only hiring clients, and empowers her staff through a coworking model. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She runs Bella Bronze Tan salons as a project manager, keeping a flat structure, recruiting specialist staff, and never hiring direct reports. While she stands to gain less financially this way, to keep good people, it’s a trade-off she’s willing to make. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For me, I’m not a beauty therapist, and I didn’t have the knowledge of all the areas of beauty to have staff work under me. There’s definitely more money to be made if people work under you, but there’s always a risk they will leave and compete. This way, we’re all working harmoniously, and there’s constant foot traffic in a like-minded environment. Plus, the clients appreciate you more because they’re going to someone who is a trained professional in that area, not a hairdresser who does nails, and vice versa.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a sense that most staff aren’t working here while in-between things. If not studying part-time for other careers, many are building careers in beauty, and through example, Jasmine is focused on showing it can be more than just a job, and a rather lucrative career, when you focus on your craft. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everyone sees the growth in the business, and recognises it might not be just a ‘job’ – the company is not going away, and if you stick around, there are so many opportunities to be involved in different areas and create a career for yourself under the BBT banner.”</span></p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest opportunity for Jasmine in recent years has been in the realm of product development. She started researching spray tan formulas and blends in 2011, before launching her own product in 2014 – “yes, product development really does take that long.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her tip? Start yesterday, get your marketing down pat from today, and protect your IP from the very beginning. Also, be prepared to sink real capital into product development, especially if you’re manufacturing in Australia. Jasmine spent $50,000 developing Bella Bronze Tan’s premier violet solution, which was a relatively small sum, as she was fortunate to initially land on a manufacturer in Victoria that worked with her the entire journey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I wasn’t happy with what I was using, and the cost started to get to me, like why am I paying all this money for a product which isn’t perfect,” she remembers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It took two years to perfect the product with the manufacturer, through many calls, back and forth, and many more emails, often at 3 am from me. I did that while mobile tanning, with my sister as my first staff member, while finding a salon, being pregnant, opening the salon. It was really hard.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Jasmine has never met her manufacturer in person, there’s something to be said for her loyalty, and she can’t be tempted with a better rate elsewhere. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And as big as she is on brand, she’s even bigger on intellectual property.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s so important you ask questions at the start, about protecting whatever you’re developing, because if you start the process only to find out later you can’t extract your IP, then what’s the point? If you see the growth in other countries, look into how you stack up in other markets, so you can keep costs down and avoid exporting – protecting your IP is absolutely key.”</span></p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Jasmine looks to other markets, with an eye on further expanding in the US, she has recognised the value of a ‘little boost’ along the way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s keen to support growing businesses herself, which is why she has chosen to sell her products direct-to-consumer, on a business-to-business level, sidestepping cosmetics giants and our local department stores, so “Janet in Toowoomba can make money selling BBT to her own clients instead”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, Jasmine recognises and remembers the cash flow boosts that have not only seen her through, but helped her own business scale and thrive. After investing in product development, Jasmine came to Moula for working capital, which she put towards marketing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In 2016, I was a sole trader at the time, and even though I had been with my bank my entire life and they could see the funds coming in and out, they didn’t want to give me a loan,” she remembers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was rebranding, and wanted a luxe look to complement our high-quality product, and the ability to order larger quantities of stock. The banks didn’t want a bar of me. If Moula didn’t support me, perhaps we wouldn’t have the products we do today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having the money there ‘nearly instantly’ was key to fuelling her growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve invested everything I own into the business. Everything. I don’t own property because I’ve been building up my company asset, which is far more valuable than property, in my opinion. So when the banks don’t want to lend you money because you don’t own property, it’s so frustrating in business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“SMEs need little boosts along the way, and for those who don’t have assets to apply at a bank, or need funding for an opportunity, Moula is really helpful.”</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What started as a passion business became a love story for the couple behind White Clover Music.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kate Tomlinson and Tom White formed White Clover Music after recognising a gap in the wedding services market. There were wedding singers, concierges, and coordinators, but there was no one-stop-shop business tying it all together for couples tying the knot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The married couple, who started out as friends, started the first business of its kind in Australia, which recently ticked over to wedding number 650.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The first year we were in deficit, the second year we broke even, and the third year we turned a profit,” says Kate. “Then every year for the three years following that, we doubled our business.”</span></p>

			<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wedding Singer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> might be a cult classic, however, White Clover Music has taken a more contemporary approach. Music is one thing, but Kate and Tom have packaged their skills to create a full-service wedding business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We may be the only ones who do what we do in the world,” says Kate. “We’ve created an offer that no one else provides, so it’s really difficult to fully communicate what we do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White Clover Music is a live duet, MC, wedding coordinator and concierge service. According to Tom, the best way to overcome the challenge of communicating what you do is simply through demonstration – and Instagram Stories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our industry is a one-time buy, so we’ve had to demonstrate and explain what we do continuously. We haven’t had anyone come back for a second wedding. By continuing to show who we are and what we do, it keeps us on our toes, which is a good, healthy thing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What that often means is stepping outside an already broad job description. Told through Stories, there’s Kate re-icing a nearly destroyed wedding cake (don’t ask), and footage of White Clover Music saving the day with a one-size-fits-all wedding dress (now a backup for every bride’s big day).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a Navy SEAL saying, if you’ve got two, you’ve gone one, and if you’ve got one, then you’ve got none. We keep backups of everything. We don’t like to say things go wrong, rather that they didn’t go to plan.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Most of the time our couples wouldn’t know these things happen until they watch our Stories.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Picking up steam, and skills, along the way, Kate complements Tom: “We compare it to a backpack, picking up different things along the way; enough to now fill our wedding van.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Practice makes perfect, and the couple have put in more than 10,000 hours together as a duet. Post-wedding, back in the van, Kate and Tom use that time to debrief, and hold space for what looks like a campaign retrospective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every time we drive home from a wedding, we have a proper debrief, and go through the things that went wrong, things that went well, how we can improve on them – and that’s usually where we come up with new ideas,” says Kate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think when people have a role, they don’t want to step outside that role, so we just make everything our role. We don’t see it as above and beyond.”</span></p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In pursuit of ‘premiumising’ wedding services, White Clover Music chose to bundle their offering, rather than expand their range. Over the years, the business has refined the number of packages it offers, such as ceremony plus coordinator, or all-day package. This has simplified pricing and created a more predictable revenue stream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was kind of a question of whether we do ourselves a disservice and not be compensated for all the things we do, or book us to do everything we can to make your wedding possible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And make it possible they do, through rain, hail, or COVID-19. Kate and Tom were booked out a year in advance when COVID hit, which meant they had to move fast. The task? Rearrange the calendar for 51 weddings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of our couples had venues and vendors who said ‘sorry you’ve lost everything’, as they were in their own financial difficulties, which is heartbreaking,” recalls Kate. “With some of our couples, who paid us 50 per cent of their amount, instead of losing that, we floated the idea of elopement considering they’d already paid for the equivalent of that service.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their eyes, doing a disservice to one customer would be doing a disservice to all customers, so White Clover Music offered complimentary postponement on a 12-month calendar basis of every wedding on their books. It was worth suffering a short-term financial blow to save their customers’ big days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve found more ways to be flexible. You can’t limit yourself by fear and anxiety. You will always come up against challenges, whether it’s the global economy, an industry slowdown, a pandemic – there will always be something. Even if we were set back, we’ve built this business once before; we can do it again, and possibly even better this time.”</span></p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only through pushing their limits could Kate and Tom determine their weaknesses. While they don’t subscribe to a creative rulebook, they’ve found it helpful to put certain systems in place. During the couple’s first year in business, they developed a simple system that clarified their core competencies, and paved the way for outsourcing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When something doesn’t get assigned to someone, it gets lost, whether that’s in your relationship or in your business,” says Tom. “So what we did was create a 3-column system incorporating job and house roles, with one column for all the things Kate liked to do or was good at, another for all the things I liked to do or was good at, then a third column for things we liked to do but weren’t necessarily good at, and hired someone to do them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keen on keeping learnings inside the business, the decision to outsource wasn’t treated lightly. However, hiring an external CFO, and later an accountant, would free the couple up to focus on their craft, and ultimately deliver a greater return on a more premium product. It also opened their eyes to the balancing act of business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We spent so much time believing we always had to work harder to make more money to keep cash flow up – that’s simply not true,” says Kate. “Cash flow is all about balancing incomings and outgoings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tom recalls their external CFO saying, ‘you have all this cash flow tied up in your future’ for 200+ weddings in their calendar, however, without charging a booking fee or requesting instalments, they couldn’t access any of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A business will always have incomings and outgoings, so it’s about staggering both, and figuring out the sweet spot that works for your business. You can bill things more regularly, in lesser amounts, and you can pay for things more regularly, in lesser amounts. By negotiating with your billers, you can then create contracts that empower your business and work for you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was on the advice of their accountant they came to Moula, to support the balancing act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our accountant put us on to Moula, which helped us when we were trying to grow,” says Kate. “We needed new equipment, and knew our money was in our future, so we wanted to make sure we could start selling our upgraded package with new equipment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always on the go, speed was a determining factor. By linking their data, Kate and Tom sped up the process, and proved they were more than a couple of wedding singers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Given we are so busy working, and we earn more money working than negotiating loan terms, what mattered more was the fact we could just call Moula, grant access to our Xero data, and clearly show that payments were in our future,” says Tom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’d sent out invoices that hadn’t fallen due yet, so could get approved pretty much straight away. It was like a 20-minute phone call. It meant we could access capital immediately, use the funds immediately, and our growth continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Otherwise we’d be running around after banks who didn’t take us seriously. It was this idea of how Moula didn’t put us in a box, that was really important.”</span></p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As business owners, both Kate and Tom have a growth mindset, believing “when there is no answer, you have to create answers”. Opportunities are yours for the taking when testing, learning and experimenting is your modus operandi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She couldn’t have done it any other way, as a self-described ‘small town girl’ from the Blue Mountains, who went from working property in Sydney’s east, to going through the Your Shot DJ program before formally studying music. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Something I wish I’d known earlier, there’s no rulebook in creative industries,” says Kate. “There are licenses, qualifications, procedures, and things like that, but what you offer and your marketing strategy, it’s all offered by you on the back of your imagination.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past, White Clover Music’s marketing strategy has incorporated hot air balloons and various stunts. Even when people have said ‘that won’t work’, the couple have simply heard, ‘that hasn’t been done yet’. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When people say you can’t do it, they aren’t the ones willing to take the risk, so you have to trust your gut. People will try and limit your potential. You have to explore things in your own imagination, look for opportunities everywhere, and take them when you see them.”</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Mike Halligan’s dog fell ill a few years ago, the ecommerce entrepreneur felt a calling to launch a business that was fairer on his pup, as well as the planet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he went down the rabbit hole of the pet food industry, he came to realise there was a lack of transparency around health and nutrition, as well as supply chains. He spotted an opportunity to launch a ‘completely different’ pet food company and hold himself up to a greater level of accountability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standing tall in a yard full of multinationals, Scratch is a subscription-only dog food service, making kibble with 98 per cent Australian ingredients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minimising the middleman, and delivering direct to people’s doors, direct-to-consumer brands like Scratch are getting cut-through in a post-COVID world. </span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people launch businesses with friends, family members, or former colleagues. In 2018, Scratch’s founders Mike Halligan and Doug Spiegelhauer approached the business a little differently. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I had the idea but I had no idea how to make dog food. Doug is the pet food guy. I just thought dog food could be done way better, and be way better for dogs, and with the right business model we’d be able to cut out some of the mark-ups along the way,” remembers Mike. (The retail mark-up can sometimes reach a staggering 80 per cent.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’d been asking everyone if they knew anyone who made dog food, and funnily enough, someone actually did. We met twice, and somehow I convinced Doug to quit his job.”</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What helps is both Mike and Doug are proud generalists. Owning their broad skill sets has served them well, especially in Scratch’s early days, when they naturally found their place in the business through trying on different hats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I wouldn’t say either of us are amazing at any one thing, but good enough to get away with not having to hire people and do things on the cheap.” says Mike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I designed and developed most of our website, then we worked with a designer on our packaging, and a nutritionist to do thorough testing on all the recipes, which ended up being more of a collaboration than a testing process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s about getting your hands dirty and finding people who both like taking responsibility for something, and actually getting it done as well. We don’t have a team of managers, we’ve got a lot of generalists instead.”</span></p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bootstrapping in the beginning allowed Scratch to stay true to its vision. In the venture capital-backed modern brand era, Scratch made a conscious choice to grow at its own pace. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solving problems with fewer resources initially helped create a competitive advantage, as the founders learnt to do it all themselves. Without a board of investors, decisions were entirely theirs, which gave them the luxury of pursuing opportunities – like that time Mick Fanning, the former surfing world champion, signed up as one of Scratch’s first 500 customers on a mate’s recommendation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keen to catch the wave, Mike nudged his mate over the next 12 months to organise a meeting on the Gold Coast with Mick, and talk all things business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were working out if the timing was right to invest, and lucky it was. He had just stepped back from surfing, had more time on his hands, and saw the difference it made to his dog Harper’s skin condition.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Scratch, virtually overnight, entered scale-up mode, that’s when the team called on extra support. Immediately after a spot on 9News, the business saw three times the amount of sign-ups than anticipated over the month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sales went crazy, and while it was stressful, it was a good position to be in – we needed extra capital to make more dog food and keep up with the demand,” remembers Mike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Moula was a really good thing for us to be able to quickly access capital to finance that inventory. The reason we chose Moula over others was we knew we’d be able to pay the money back quickly within a month and it didn’t have any early repayment fees. That made the biggest difference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Things like Moula help us operate the way we want to operate, with a bit of cash flow possibility.” </span></p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From developing creative to performance marketing, Scratch keeps everything in house, making collaboration easier, even with Mike in Amsterdam and Doug in country Victoria. This keeps staff on the ball, continuously testing, learning and optimising the marketing mix.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most of the outside work was the packaging and the actual food itself. But we love to do everything we can, in-house, keep that knowledge, build on it and share our learnings. We don’t really use agencies or anything like that, it’s all about getting better ourselves.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Mike’s view, Scratch’s tone of voice is one of two most critical parts of not just the brand, but the entire business. Along with logistics, it’s what sets the business apart from incumbents, as well as other challengers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s having a real clear point of view on what Scratch versus what another dog food company would do – that’s a really big thing for us,” he says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It helps our team know they don’t have to get sign-off on everything they say; they can think for themselves. It gives them a license to make their own decisions without being micromanaged.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Dry dog food is quite a dry topic, and we’re in a stale industry. It’s a big business game, so all the life got sucked out of it. We were keen to bring that back as much as possible. Working with dogs, it should be the most fun, light, joyous experience.”</span></p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, things can still get in the way, particularly down the supply chain, whether you’re an SME or in the big business game. Mike has a hunch that customers also expect a different level of service from a business which promises convenience on subscription. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scratch uses local ingredients, at the mercy of Australia’s sometimes favourable, often brutal, weather and climate systems. Until recently, over the life of the business, farmers in our eastern states had been battling a multi-year drought, where conditions peaked in the deadly 2019-20 bushfire season. Now, in 2021, many of these same farmers have suddenly gone from drought to deluge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you’re using natural ingredients impacted by the seasons, then you can really have a tough supply chain,” says Mike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re always in problem-solving mode, when it’s too late, business can be incredibly hard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At times, you’ll find you can meet the demand, you just need more capital to make more food ahead of time. Being on top of forecasting, knowing how much food we have to make, so we don’t let anyone down – efficient forecasting makes a subscription business work like a dream.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, Mike admits the last 12 months have been tricky at times, due to COVID-19 and its impact on supply, shipping and logistics. In 2020, Scratch opened a new warehouse in Perth, adding to their Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane operations. Try as they might, challenges with Australia Post snapped the business into reactive mode.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anything in a large box got really stuffed over by COVID, as Australia Post focused on getting as many small packages into a truck as possible and pretty much ignored the larger boxes,” recalls Mike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’ve got all these dogs wanting food on time, but our packages were getting deprioritised and lost in Australia Post, taking 3-4 weeks to arrive, which was an absolute nightmare. We ended up using couriers for a few months, costing us tens of thousands of dollars.”</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responsibility to people and planet is baked into the Scratch business model. The founders are friendly with Koala, Who Gives A Crap, and other purpose-driven Aussie businesses, who together sound out ways to make an impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the beginning, Scratch has donated 1 per cent of its revenues to environmental and social causes. It recently doubled that amount. Now, 1 per cent goes towards dog welfare charities, with the remaining 1 per cent allocated to fighting pollution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re at the point where we’re growing up so we can do a lot of the things we want to do, but never had the scale to do,” offers Mike. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scratch recently applied to become a B Corp, a certification reserved for businesses that meet the highest standards of social and environmental performance, public transparency, and legal accountability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They judge you on your actions, not your intent. If you see the B Corp logo, you know the business has done the work.”</span></p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Achieving carbon neutrality is an overarching goal. Through carbon offsetting, reducing emissions, and a tonne of commitment, Scratch aims to neutralise its contribution to greenhouse gases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve started to focus on the effects of ecommerce, which is delivery, warehousing and packaging, and delivering that in a way that’s as impactful as possible, ideally being as positive or more positive than going to the store,” explains Mike. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Corporate social responsibility is something we really care about, although something that’s hard to do when you’re small. As long as you’ve got suppliers, and you’re not a big enough piece of business for them, you’re seemingly at their whims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At this point, it’s carbon neutral for the delivery itself, rather than our whole operations. In terms of the stuff we directly control, we’re fully carbon neutral, but we’re still working with suppliers to get them fully carbon neutral.”</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 came with its challenges, which demanded extra coordination, but it didn’t change how the business worked day-to-day. That’s because, from scratch, Mike and Doug have encouraged asynchronous, remote-first communication. (Top tip: Scratch runs on software called Twist.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Async’ communication is when you send a message without expecting an immediate response. In an async environment, employees have agency to move projects forward on their own schedule. There’s a focus on results, not hours worked. When a company can make it work, async reduces stress and increases productivity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Working asynchronously means we post updates throughout the day and have a few meetings, maybe two or three, throughout the week – for a remote business, we run on very few meetings, and a lot of text updates instead,” explains Mike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a very autonomous, ‘run your own day’ environment, where you update people and request help when you need a hand. Unless it’s super important, people get to stuff in their own time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coming close to burnout in the first year of business, Mike says the importance of restoring boundaries between life and work can’t be understated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Asynchronous means choosing what’s relevant to you, shutting out the noise, shouting out when you need a hand, and getting stuff done without distractions. The ability to focus, govern your own day, work from where you want, when you want, and just do a good job, rather than simply being online and contactable all the time, is the way for modern working.”</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his time at the helm of VitrineMedia Australia, Michael has built up a client base that stretches ASX-listed clients to the nation’s biggest property groups. If it’s a retail or real estate storefront on a high street, chances are, it’s powered by VitrineMedia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael took the opportunity to head up VitrineMedia Australia in 2012, as an Australian subsidiary under a French parent company, focused on selling LED display screens and signs. While he experienced success as a subsidiary, as the years went on, Michael felt ready to take the reins on a new opportunity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I thought we had a whole lot more to offer as a wholly-owned Australian business,” explains Michael. “In October last year, we bit the bullet, and said, hey, we’d like to buy the business and distribution, and that’s where it really started.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was hard to break away from the parent company and lose the safety net of having their money behind us, and now it’s my money, my life, attached to this business. But I felt confident and passionate enough about the business, and knew it would work.”</span></p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael had a track record for taking an idea and making it work. All he needed was a bit of momentum on his side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the age of 12, he worked exclusively in sales, from menswear to the motor trade, honing his craft under the mentorship of his uncle – “the best salesperson I’ve ever, ever seen in my life”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In sales, and business, as he later learnt, you gain momentum by leaning into the little tailwinds. Or, as any sales pro knows, turning a potential headwind into a tailwind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael mastered the latter when faced with copycats in the early days with VitrineMedia. Competitors were importing knock-off LED products, which would often fail at the six-month mark. He needed to make a distinction. </span></p>
<p>After deciding to personally remove the imitation product from other stores, he then offered the potential customer 50 per cent off – keeping his good name, while building up the business.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One thing I’ve always been a proponent of, when times are tough, and when the market is tough the way it is today, that’s the best time to grow your business and make your mark on your space, so when the market turns – and it will turn – you will be that far ahead in brand awareness,” says Michael.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strategy paid off, with the right people taking note. Soon after, VitrineMedia landed a contract with Flight Centre to supply LED displays across more than 600 stores. </span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Flight Centre contract was absolutely massive for us. It was huge. Apart from the value of the contract, it gave us an amazing profile,” he says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the biggest travel groups, globally, had done their due diligence and decided – hey, VitrineMedia works best for us. That was the launching pad for many other retail areas we’ve gone into, like Retail Food Group stores and Clear Skincare Clinics.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flight Centre was the vote of confidence that VitrineMedia needed – in Michael’s words, “we would’ve survived without it, but we would’ve struggled”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The contract provided a flight path for the business, but it didn’t come with the promise of clear skies ahead. Scaling up created an entirely new set of challenges for VitrineMedia.</span></p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash flow, as any SME knows, ebbs and flows, especially in businesses that are reliant on contracts, and at the mercy of traditional trade terms. How can you realistically forecast revenue, and effectively manage your inventory, when you can’t accurately anticipate purchase orders? In the absence of a crystal ball, Michael needed another solution.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the early days, as a subsidiary, our trade terms were really lenient – 120, 150, 180-days, and the rest – so we could invest in huge amounts of stock and stagger the payments very comfortably,” says Michael. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When I took over, that was the first thing that changed – everything became a 30-day account, with 50 per cent required upfront, then it became 80 per cent upfront. When you’re getting a $100,000 container every six weeks, it can get a little tight.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael got a business loan from Moula, so he could keep growing his business without straining his cash flow. He sums it up as: “Short-term help for long-term gain”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One thing I’ve got to say, you can’t grow your business by shrinking it. You can’t stop spending and hope to grow your business, It just doesn’t work like that. You’ve obviously got to be smart with where you spend your money, but have to look at your ROI, and have to spend in order to grow.”</span></p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was that thinking, around five years ago, that brought Michael to his next big idea. In response to growing customer demand, he launched a print division. This was a time when the rest of the market started lasering into digital and backlist LEDs. Ironically, through print, Michael future-proofed his business, and modernised his business model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The backlit LED screens have a 10-year warranty, so you sell to someone, and really have no reason to sell them anything else for 10 years – no recurring revenue streams,” explains Michael. “That, to me, was a flawed business model.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A contract with coffee chain Gloria Jeans led to the formation of a new business division, focused on food-safe, sustainable print products. It’s made possible by latex, water-based ink, which is soluble, recyclable, and importantly to clients, provides high saturation of colour.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In business, it should always be a question of ‘what-if’ – people might suddenly stop buying LEDs, so let’s consider some of the other ways we can guarantee a reasonable lifespan, and potentially franchise down the track,” says Michael.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We now have two large-format latex printers in the office, and our printing division makes up almost 50 per cent of the business. We’re even looking at launching a print-on-demand model, with digital asset management software, which no one in Australia currently does.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael won’t give away all his trade secrets, but he can reveal how forward thinking got him here. With two young daughters, he’s thinking more about environmental sustainability, and turning a greater focus to corporate social responsibility in general.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You need to sit down and look at your business model. And not look at it from here into the next two years, but the next 5 or 10 years, and have a really good market study. Everything starts with an idea, but the idea you start with will very quickly morph into something very different by the time you finish with it. When I look at where we started, where we’ve gone, where we’re going, it’s a completely different business model.”</span></p>

			<p><b>Melbourne, Australia</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Government has pledged $1.2 billion in this year’s Budget towards building out a modern and digital economy, with SMEs set to benefit at the centre.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recognising the potential of ‘transformative’ AI technologies, the funding, as Treasurer Josh Frydenberg put it, will be used to ‘deliver Australia’s first AI action plan’. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In what’s being hailed as our Digital Economy Strategy, around 15 per cent of the billion-dollar-plus investment will go towards AI research and grants, and setting up a National Artificial Intelligence Centre.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Located at CSIRO’s Data61 in Docklands, Melbourne, the National Artificial Intelligence Centre will support SMEs in harnessing new technologies to grow their business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the Centre will act as a ‘front door’ for Australian businesses looking for expertise, knowledge, and tools to harness AI. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moula Chief Product and Data Officer, Paul Pesavento, said we’re just scratching the surface of what Australia can achieve through leveraging AI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It has never been easier to start a business, and this year’s Budget goes a long way in making it easier to scale a business with technology,” said Pesavento.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tech plays a critical role. On top of removing barriers to entry through initiatives like the Entrepreneurs’ Programme, extending investment incentives, and reducing regulatory burdens, this Budget opens doors to the tech that can help all SMEs scale.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, much of the investment in AI is concentrated in larger businesses operating in industries such as healthcare and fintech. In partnership with Microsoft, Moula has been using </span><a href="https://news.microsoft.com/en-au/features/moula-relies-on-microsoft-ai-to-power-sme-lending/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI, data, and machine learning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for several years to assess business loan applications from SMEs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;AI is transformative for business in the way it speeds up processes and automates manual work, which is exactly what time-poor SMEs want and need,” said Pesavento.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At Moula, we&#8217;ve been using AI to help service our business loan customers faster, bringing our average credit decision time down from 24 hours to less than two. This has enabled us to deliver over $500 million in funding to SMEs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re proud to see the Government investing in uplifting digital capabilities across Australia, so that adoption isn&#8217;t concentrated just among tech companies, but also reaches SMEs who are the engine room of our economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Digital Economy Strategy is a welcome next step, increasing awareness around the many and varied applications of AI, while democratising solutions to improve industry competitiveness.”</span></p>
